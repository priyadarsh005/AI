# React 101 - React Tutorials for beginners
All the working files for the React 101 tutorials published on YouTube.

We will build 3 demos:

- Collapsible component
- Fetching data
- Currency converter

## How to use these files?

Each folder is a new project, you will need to repeat this process for all 3 projects.

1. Open `01-Start` folder in VSCode
2. Navigate to `01-Start` in the terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install all dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the dev server
5. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in the browser

You should see a demo looking exactly like in my videos. Follow step by step.
